  Our project is a chess game. It provides same functionalities and player experience
  as any multiplayer online chess game. Some special moves our game supports include 
  castling, en passant and automatic promotion of Pawn to Queen. Our game prints 
  previous moves made, allows backtracking, and even highlights all possible moves a piece 
  can take. The GUI takes inspiration from chess.com.
